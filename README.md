# CSV to SQL File Converter
A python project that converts a given CSV file to an SQL file that can be imported in a PostgreSQL database or you can let the script create the table and insert the data for you.

## Project Status
The project is still under development and the current version is a basic version that I can use to guide myself and implement new features based on this initial version.
PS: The hardcoded parts will be changed to be defined by the user.

## Usage
For now, if you want to use the project with your custom CSV file, you'll need to clone the project to your computer and put your file inside the project folder.  Open the `main.py` file and change the hardcoded file name and separator at line 119.
